"""Tutorial 11: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) with SIMP API

This tutorial demonstrates a three-party computation using FHE (CKKS scheme):
1. All three parties generate random floating-point numbers
2. Party 0 generates FHE context pair (private and public)
3. Party 0 broadcasts the public context to all parties
4. Each party encrypts their data using the public context
5. Each party sends their encrypted data to Party 0
6. Party 0 computes operations (sum, product, dot product, polynomial evaluation)
7. Party 0 decrypts the results

FHE vs PHE:
- PHE (Partially Homomorphic): Supports either addition OR multiplication (not both)
- FHE (Fully Homomorphic): Supports BOTH addition AND multiplication on encrypted data
- CKKS scheme: Optimized for approximate floating-point arithmetic
- BFV scheme: Optimized for exact integer arithmetic
