# Dataflow Legend: SecureBoost histogram
#   binning -> masks -> encrypted histogram -> gain computation
# ==============================================================================
# Roles
# - AP (Active Party): holds gradients/hessians (GH), owns FHE secret key, computes
#   decryptions and split gains. Does NOT have raw features.
# - PP (Passive Party): holds features, computes per-(group,feature,bucket) masks,
#   and uses plaintext masks for ct·pt with AP's ciphertext vectors. Does NOT have GH or secret key.
#
# Inputs
# - subgroup_map: (group_size, m), 1 where sample belongs to a tree node (group)
# - order_map:    (m, n), bucket index per (sample, feature), -1 for invalid/masked
# - GH on AP (ciphertexts) are shared to PPs:
#     classic:   g_ct (m,), h_ct (m,)           # separate ciphertext vectors
#     interleave: gh_ct (2m,) as [g0,h0,g1,h1,...]  # single interleaved ciphertext
#
# Pipeline (per group g, feature f, cumulative bucket b)
# 1) Binning (PP):
#    order_map[:, f] gives bucket ids per sample; subgroup_map[g] selects the group.
#
# 2) Mask building (PP):
#    mask[i] = 1 iff subgroup_map[g][i] == 1 and order_map[i, f] <= b else 0  # shape (m,)
#    interleaved path duplicates mask to inter_mask (2m,) => [mask, mask] at even/odd positions.
#
# 3) Encrypted histogram (PP side computation):
#    AP sends Enc(G/H) vectors to PP. PP computes ct·pt dot locally with plaintext masks:
#    - classic:
#        g_sum_ct = dot(g_ct, mask_pt)  # run at PP
#        h_sum_ct = dot(h_ct, mask_pt)  # run at PP
#    - interleaved-fused (if used): compute fused masked reductions on PP with selectors.
#    PP then sends only scalar ciphertexts back to AP.
#
# 4) Decrypt & gain (AP):
#    AP decrypts all bucket sums, forms cumulative histograms, evaluates split gains,
#    and chooses the best (feature, threshold) per node.
#
# Security model
# - PP never learns GH or decrypted sums; only builds/encrypts masks.
# - AP never learns raw features or masks; only receives ciphertexts and decrypts aggregates.
# - Only aggregate bucket-level statistics are revealed to AP, matching SecureBoost.
