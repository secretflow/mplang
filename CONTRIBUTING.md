# Contributing to MPLang

First off, thank you for considering contributing to MPLang! It's people like you that make MPLang such a great tool. We welcome any form of contribution, from documentation and bug reports to new features.

## Setting up the Development Environment

To get started, you'll need to set up your local environment for development.

### 1. Prerequisites

You'll need the following tools installed:

- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)**: A fast Python package installer and resolver.
  ```bash
  # Install uv on Linux/macOS
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```
- **[buf](https://buf.build/docs/installation)**: For Protobuf code generation.
  ```bash
  # Install buf by following the official guide: https://buf.build/docs/installation
  ```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Once the prerequisites are installed, clone the repository and install the required Python packages for development in editable mode.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/secretflow/mplang.git
cd mplang

# Install dependencies, including development tools
uv sync --group dev

# Install the project in editable mode
uv pip install -e .
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Code Generation

If you modify any `.proto` files in the `protos/` directory, you must regenerate the Python code.

```bash
buf generate
```

### 2. Running Tests

We use `pytest` for testing.

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run tests in parallel for speed
uv run pytest -n auto

# Run a specific test file
uv run pytest tests/core/test_primitive.py
```

### 3. Code Quality

We use `ruff` for linting and formatting, and `mypy` for static type checking. Please run these tools before submitting your changes.

```bash
# Format code
uv run ruff format .

# Lint and automatically fix issues
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Run the type checker
uv run mypy mplang/
```

## Submitting Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
2.  Make your changes and ensure all tests and code quality checks pass.
3.  Push your branch and open a pull request against the `main` branch.
4.  Provide a clear description of your changes in the pull request.

Thank you for your contribution!
