        For table-like objects (e.g., pandas DataFrame), JSON serialization is used.

    Notes:
        Argument binding semantics with respect to JAX static arguments:

        - If an argument (or any leaf within a PyTree argument) is an
          :class:`~mplang.core.mpobject.MPObject`, it is captured as a runtime
          variable (dynamic value) in the traced program and is not treated as a
          JAX static argument.
        - If an argument contains no :class:`MPObject` leaves, it is treated as a
          constant configuration with respect to JAX; effectively it behaves
          like a static argument and may contribute to JAX compilation cache
          keys (similar to ``static_argnums`` semantics). Changing such constant
          arguments can lead to different compiled variants/cached entries.
